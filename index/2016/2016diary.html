                      it's interresting that everyone can't just be honest with themselves. i think ppl esp nowadays don't knowhow to act with the world with so many things going on that they kid themselves into thinking their own self is less important or maybe too important to pay any real attention to. it takes real effort to take care of yourself or keep yourself healthyand people take that for granted tbh. i wish more ppl took a second to just chill out and think baout what they need.

                      i wish i could be honest with myself though. even when i try, i don't know what to do. i dont think im that important. i'm only fourteen. i got my whole life ahead of me, but i'm not excited. am i supposed to be excited? is anyone excited? seems like a lot of years of shit to go through. fourteen of these years have been pretty shitty already. sorry. i should be more grateful. i am grateful, just sad that i'm here.
