            i'm getting more hopeless by the day. i wish people saw it more, asked me if i'm okay, but i can't expect that they know i'm hurting. but i'm too scared to say anything in fear of judgment or repreccusions. i think my eating is getting worse — it's never been particularly good, to be fair, but lately everything just feels overwhelming and i can't bring myself to eat because i'm too anxious. i give my food away, lie to my mom about where it went. oh god, i'm a liar. she works hard for that food too. is it possible to feel even more guilty? i'm a terrible person, i don't deserve as good of a mom as i have. i wish i didn't exist. i wish that i could disappear. if someone were to ask me, "what is this about?", i couldn't tell you a single thing other than i'm scared and tired and don't want to be here.
