                it comes as a surprise to no one that time heals most wounds. i wish i could tell myself a year ago that everything would be fine.. maybe not perfect but i'll be fine. not everything has to be on my shoulders, not everyone is out to get me. i really hope that a year from now, i'll be saying the same things in the present tense. i'm happy. i'm healthy. i'm fine.

                they always say loving yourself is the way to heal all wounds. i call bullshit. loving yourself and your body is so difficult and feels impossible at times. i think practicing body neutrality is so much more effective and important. it's realistic. no one has a perfect relationship with themselves, and being at a neutral state — without intense emotion — i feel is the best place to be mentally.
