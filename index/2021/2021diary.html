                i think a lot of people find comfort in sadness in the same way people find comfort in positivity. it's weird to say, especially if it's not an experience you particularly share, but it's there. i think as humans we all seek comfort in the some way. when i was at the hospital, i found myself confronting how comfortable i was in my own sadness and the habits i've created for myself. i think happiness always feels very fleeting and unstable, so it's only natural that sadness becomes the substitute. in the future, i really want to become a person that appreciates the happiness in my life. i want to be able to create happy memories, look forward to the future, etc. it's a scary road ahead, long and windy, but i'm alive to take the journey.
