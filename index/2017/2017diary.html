                girls are so beautiful. the kind of beautiful that makes you question why your heart is beatingg so fast and why you keep staring for no reason. there's really no reason to be looking, except that everything seems to be drawing you forward, at her, towards her â€” whatever. i've been feeling this way for a while, and i think i've finally grasped that thinking woman are aesthetically beautiful does not equate to what i'm feeling. it's like everything i want to do with guys, i wouldn't mind doing with women. the kissing, the touching. it's not weird, is it? i hope it's not weird. i think i like this girl in my class. she's gorgeous, charistmatic, kind and pretty much everything i'm not. i don't think she'll ever look at me like that but it's okay. it's not like it matters. it's only high school.. nothing matters in high school.
