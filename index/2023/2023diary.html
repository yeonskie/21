                progress is never linear. there are very few things in life that have a perfectly linear progression, and mental/physical health is definitely not one of them. it's more like a rollercoaster going up and down with no sign of stopping. it's nervewracking and it's exhausting but it's also part of living and progressing beyond your own faults.

                i really wish i could tell younger myself that setbacks and bumps in the road only make you stronger. that feeling weak or upset doesn't equate to true failure. progress is progress, even if it is backwards, forwards, to the side. maybe even a pause. it's there. you're okay. you lived through it.
