                <p>The main reason I’m here, to recover, has not been lost to me. I don’t know when or how it’ll happen, nor when I will get out of this place…all I can do is hope that one day it will be alright. Sometimes I feel a deep sense of inadequacy, unfulfillment. Anxiety and I are well-acquainted friends, almost too close to bear. I hate how its toxicity rules my life, the way I live my life. Being stable is a goal but never a reality. I’m not sure where to go or who to tell where I can go. I’m tired, exhausted…I feel like I’m out of options, that everyone here dislikes me and that I’m unlikeable in general. True or a figment of my imagination?
                </p>
                <p>I am often hard on myself for no reason at all. I use the words “pathetic” “embarrassing” etc. to describe my every fault or error. Even things I’m struggling with on a fundamental level—always turn toward the negatives in my brain. It makes me a slave to my own degrading thoughts. Enough that the self-criticism is not only an abstract but now a voice in my head, begging to be drawn away from the toxicity that are my thoughts and opinions of myself.</p>
