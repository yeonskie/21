                i've spent a lot of time thinking and not a lot of time acting. i'm caught up in my head and so hyper aware of my circumstances that i forget i can actually do something about them. i don't know. maybe i'll admit myself at the hospital nearby, like everyone is telling me to do because i think it's getting really bad nowadays, before i do something silly like die by my own hand. wouldn't that be so silly? there's so many things in the world that are out to get you, but you end up dying by something as silly as wanting your body to look a certain way. it's hilarious. it's funny, in the grand scheme of things â€” how much your brain can trick you into caring about something so minimal.
