                i spent the whole day reading again... sometimes i wish i could just curl up into a ball and dive straight first into those books. it'd be so much better, wouldn't it? the magic, the characters come to life. i wouldn't have to worry about what people think of me. 
                <br>i think i worry too much sometimes. mom says its normal for a kid my age, but idkkk. i'm like, always, anxious that someone is looking at me or teasing me or making fun of me. it's getting to be a lot, but i guess i'll just have to deal with it.
                <br>my friends are a lot nicer now. i almost forgot about the last couple months when they weren't talking to me. i missed them, but i don't think they missed me. i cried so much when they wouldn't talk to me but now that they are i'm happy again. i can't wait to be a high school student soon. it'll be better, i think. anything beats middle school tbh. worst years of my <i>life.</i>
